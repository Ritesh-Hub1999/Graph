Example 1:

Input:
-----
N=6
knightPos[ ] = {4, 5}
targetPos[ ] = {1, 1}

Output:
------
3

Explanation:
------------
Knight takes 3 step to reach from 
(4, 5) to (1, 1):
(4, 5) -> (5, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (1, 1).
 

Your Task:
----------
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function 
minStepToReachTarget() which takes the initial position of Knight (KnightPos), the target 
position of Knight (TargetPos), and the size of the chessboard (N) as input parameters and 
returns the minimum number of steps required by the knight to reach from its current position
to the given target position or return -1 if its not possible.

 Approch:
 --------
knightPos[] = {4, 5}  
targetPos[] = {1, 1}
